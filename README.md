# Data Preprocessing

# Student Dropout Prediction Model  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a deep understanding of how to prepare data for a machine learning model, specifically for a student dropout prediction model. The datasets used in this project are from different sources and are related to student performance and dropout rates.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
  - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Rank and select significant features using statistical and model-based techniques.  

- **Model Development**:  
  - Train and validate neural network models using TensorFlow/Keras.  
  - Apply techniques such as SMOTE for handling class imbalance.  

- **Bias Mitigation**:  
  - Identify and mitigate data biases to ensure fairness and equity in the predictions.
